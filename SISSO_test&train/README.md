# SISSO Model with Cross-Validation and Seed Sensitivity Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for running the SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) algorithm with additional validation techniques including stratified 5-fold cross-validation and seed sensitivity analysis.

## Overview

The SISSO algorithm is a powerful method for feature selection and model construction in scientific domains where interpretable models are essential. These scripts offer the basic SISSO implementation using TorchSisso. And the two validation techniques is added to assess model stability.
## Files Description

### 1. SISSO+seed.py
Performs seed sensitivity analysis on SISSO models by testing multiple random seeds for data shuffling and model training. This helps evaluate the stability of SISSO models against different data partitions.

**Key features:**
- Tests multiple random seeds (default: 20)
- Compares performance metrics across different data splits
- Generates comprehensive visualizations and Excel reports
- Analyzes equation consistency across different seeds

### 2. SISSO+stratified_5-fold_CV.py
Implements stratified 5-fold cross-validation for SISSO models. This approach ensures that each fold maintains the same distribution of the target variable, providing a more reliable performance estimate.

**Key features:**
- Stratified sampling based on target variable distribution
- 5-fold cross-validation with consistent evaluation metrics
- GPU support detection and utilization
- Comprehensive parity plots for visualization

### 3. SISSO.py
Basic implementation of the SISSO algorithm for training and testing on selected datasets. This is the basic SISSO implementation using TorchSisso [1].

**Key features:**
- Standard SISSO model training and evaluation
- Customizable operator set
- Detailed parity plot visualization

### 4. full data.xlsx
It contains all the initial data, consistent with Table S4. For specific data processing procedures, please refer to the methodology described in our work.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TorchSisso
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- torch

## Usage

### Basic SISSO Model
```bash
python sissotext.py
```

### Seed Sensitivity Analysis
```bash
python SISSO+seed.py
```

### Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation
```bash
python SISSO+stratified_5-fold_CV.py
```

## Data Format

Input data should be in Excel format with the following structure:
- Features: Multiple columns with descriptive names
- Target: A column named "Target" containing the dependent variable

Example dataset structure:
| Target | Feature1 | Feature2 | Feature3 | ... | 
|--------|----------|----------|----------|-----|
| 5.6    | 1.2      | 0.5      | 3.4      | ... |
| 7.2    | 2.1      | 1.2      | 4.1      | ... |

## Customization

### Operators
You can customize the set of operators used by SISSO by modifying the `operators` list:
```python
operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/', '||']  # Add or remove operators as needed
```

### Model Parameters
Adjust SISSO parameters in the model initialization:
```python
sm = SissoModel(traindata, operators, None, 2, 4, 10)
# Parameters: data, operators, multi_task, n_expansion, n_term, k
```

## Output

The scripts generate:
1. Performance metrics (RÂ², RMSE) for training and testing
2. Visualizations (parity plots, sensitivity analysis charts)
3. Excel files with detailed results
4. Equation frequency analysis (seed sensitivity script)
